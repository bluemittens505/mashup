# Mashup project

This project uses the API from theguardian.com to create a page containing a list of categories related to animals.
A click on a category reveals a list of articles each with a headline, byline, date, picture, summary, and link to
full article on theguardian.com.
Each time you click on a category, a new list of articles is retrieved.
The article list is emptied when you click on the X and close the category.
